# Reinforcement Learning basics repository
My repository for model-free reinforcement learning algorithms implemented in several environements from the OpenAI gym.
The codes are based on pseudocodes presented in Sutton & Barto's book. 

# Reinforcement_Learning_basics/Qlearning
Implementation of model-free off-policy Q-learning algorithm in the cart pole and mountain car environments.

# Reinforcement_Learning_basics/SARSA
Implementation of model-free on-policy SARSA algorithm in the cart pole, mountain car and acrobot environments.
